# ReferenceMaster
Carrying out software engineering research? Here is my bibtex file containing papers/resources that I cite in my recent papers targeting mainly to the code smells and maintainability domain.

This bib file contains all the references I cite.

I (try to) follow the following rules
- Tag of each entry in \<First name of first author\>\<year in 4 letters\>[a/b/...]
- No publisher address
- No URL of the document
- No Keywords
- No bibsource
- Add new resource entry in the master and use this bib file in all the papers by creating a symbolic link using the following command.
```
ln sourceFile.bib targetFile.bib
```
